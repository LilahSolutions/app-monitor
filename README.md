With [Upptime](https://upptime.js.org), you can get your own unlimited and free uptime monitor and status page, powered entirely by a GitHub repository. We use [Issues](https://github.com/LilahSolutions/app-monitor/issues) as incident reports, [Actions](https://github.com/LilahSolutions/app-monitor/actions) as uptime monitors, and [Pages](https://lilahsolutions.github.io) for the status page.
